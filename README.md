### Overview of the replication package
---

This replication package is structured as follows:

```
    /
    .
    |--- analysis/                      The data that has been generated through our experiments, scripts to process, analyse, and visualize this data, and the final visualization results.
    |--- applications                   The benchmarks used in our experiments. Four different computational problems, implemented in four different porgramming languages.
    |--- environment                    An Ansible setup used to automatically deploy the experiment setup on multiple network devices at once, and a Docker setup to compile our benchmarks to WASM executables.
    |--- experiment-runner @ 1613d3d    The experiment setup based on an ICSE 2012 tool demo paper. This Git submodule represents our modifications to the original project to fit the needs of this paper.
```

The `experiment-runner @ 1613d3d` is based on *Robot Runner* introduced by Stan Swanborn et al. in [Robot Runner: A Tool for Automatically Executing Experiments on Robotics Software](https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSE-Companion52605.2021.00029), and was forked from [this repository](https://github.com/S2-group/experiment-runner).

Each of the folders listed above are described in details in the remaining of this readme. Crutially, the [USAGE.md](./USAGE.md) describe how to use this replication package in detail.

### Analysis
---
This folder contains the data that has been generated through our experiments, scripts to process, analyse, and visualize this data, and the final visualization results.
```
analysis
    .
    |--- assets/                                        The dataset used to generate visualizations, as well as the final graphs.
        |--- data/                                      The cleaned dataset generated through experimentation.
            |--- dataset_aggregated_benchmarks.tsv      The data is stored as a TSV file, containing all data columns generated per experiment run, including the specific benchmark used, energy usage, execution time, memory usage, and cpu usage.
        |--- plots/                                     The generated plots, based on the dataset above. We generated three different types of plots, taking all data points into account as feasible.
            |--- boxplots
            |--- density
            |--- histograms
    |--- core/                                          A set of basic analysis utilities that is used throughout the analysis and visualization of data repeatedly. This includes effect size estimation, hypothesis testing, normality tests, outlier removal, and more.
    |--- utils/                                         A set of basic utilities to simplify the process of working with our dataset.
        |--- latex/                                     A set of utilities to generate LaTeX code for tables from our data that were used in the final paper.
        |--- fix_decimal_notation.py                    A tool to limit the number of decimal places in our data representation to allow for use in 3rd party tools such as Excel.
        |--- merge_benchmarks_results.py                A tool to group our benchmark data by language and runtime used to simplify the visual inspection.
    |--- visualization/                                 Scripts to generate our final graphs. They use the shared analysis components listed in the 'core' folder above.
        |--- boxplots.r
        |--- density.r
        |--- histograms.r
```

The data in the TSV file has been generated from several results and different experimentat runs. The data was merged by hand, however, this is the only manual interaction within this process.

### Applications
---
This folder contains the benchmarks used in our experiments. Four different computational problems, implemented in four different porgramming languages.
All benchmarks are taken from [The Computer Language Benchmarks Game](https://benchmarksgame-team.pages.debian.net/benchmarksgame/index.html) and, if needed, adapter for our purposes.
They do not use multi-threading, as WASM does not support that out-of-the-box.

### Experiment Runner
---

Our experiment setup uses the [experiment-runner](https://github.com/S2-group/experiment-runner) to execute experiments in a controlled environment. This experiment runner comes with its own documentation, which can be found in the corresponding repository. However, we modified it to fit our needs. We will highlight the most important additions below:

```
experiment-runner @ 1613d3d
    .
    |--- WasmExperiment/                    Folder containing assets required for our experiments.         
        |--- Binaries/                      WASM binaries for each benchmark in each teste language.
        |--- Experiment/                    Experiment setup.
            |--- RunnerConfig.py            Configuration for the experiment runner that uses our custom plugin (see below) to run our experiment and measure results. The configuration we used for our experiment is defined in our paper.
    |--- experiment-runner/
        |--- ConfigValidator/
        |--- EventManager/
        |--- ExperimentOrchestrator/
        |--- ExtendedTyping/
        |--- Plugins/
            |--- Profilers/
            |--- WasmExperiments/           Our custom plugin for this experiment.
                |--- ProcessManager.py      A class wrapping a process. It allows to control the process' execution, as well as monitoring using the 'Time' program.
                |--- Profiler.py            A class providing a basic interface to profile an arbitrary process, as well as a specific implementation for measuring performance with 'ps' and energy consumption using 'PowerJoular'. These profilers are then bundled in a wrapping profiler that measures both for the same process.
                |--- Runner.py              A class providing a simplified interaction interface with the experiment runner, and a implementation of this interface to perform our experiment, handling both, the execution of the correct binaries in a corresponding run, as well as the data measurement using the profiler defined above.
            |--- CodecarbonWrapper.py
        |--- ProcessManager/
    |--- test-standalone/
    |--- test/
    |--- requirements.txt
