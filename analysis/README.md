# Analysis

Here are all our data analysis related scripts and final assets. Specifically:

- the `assets` folder contains exported plots in PDF format and raw CSV data with meaningful naming conventions
- the `core` folder contains our R scripts for basic data operation and exploration (e.g., normality tests)
- the `utils` folder contains other scripts (in Python and bash) which we used at some point during our project
- the `visualization` folder contains our R visualization scripts for generating the plots that we provide in the `assets` folder
